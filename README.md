### A fake restaurant with a login page, nutrition facts, navigation, and various other information.

### This project was my first attempt at creating a detailed website. It isn't meant to be taken too seriously and was an excellent learning experience.
### It is made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
### The website is mostly operational but there are some unresolved issues with the login page. My goal was not to create a login page and it was added just to learn more so its functionality is not important.
### I learned a great deal about formatting from this page. I used bootstrap, read through my textbook, and watched a lot of tutorials in order to make this page look how it does. Most of my CSS experiences comes from this project.
### Given a chance to remake this, I would add more links and pages so the result would be more similar to a real restaurant page. I only have one nutrition page here and 3 entries but I would like to add much more. In addition, I would add a functional login page with ways to change account information.
